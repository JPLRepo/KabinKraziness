V0.4.0 Support for KSP 1.1.

V0.3.2 Support for KSP 1.0.5
V0.3.1 Support for KSP 1.0.3
V0.3 Converted Kevin to Celsius in the temperature displays for command pods. Added KSP-AVC support.
V0.2 Recompile for KSP V1.0.0
V0.1a Fixed dependency with AmpYear. Moved AmpYear and KabinKraziness to shared folder in /gamedata/REPOSoftTech.
V0.1 Removed KabinKraziness from AmpYear and made it separate option implementation (hence this OP).
